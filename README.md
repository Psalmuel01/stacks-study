# 🧠 Clarity Projects on Stacks

This repository contains a collection of smart contract projects and decentralized applications built using **Clarity**, the smart contract language for the **Stacks blockchain**.

The goal is to document my learning process as I explore how to write secure and expressive Clarity contracts and build functional dApps that interact with them.

## 🔧 Projects Included So Far

### 1. Hello World Contract

A basic Clarity smart contract to get familiar with the syntax, structure, and deployment process on the Stacks blockchain.

### 2. Secret Wisher dApp

A decentralized application that allows users to send secret wishes. This project includes both the Clarity smart contract and a simple frontend built to interact with it.

### 3. Tic Tac Toe

A tic tac toe game built using Clarity and deployed on the Stacks blockchain.

## 🛣️ Roadmap

As I continue learning and experimenting, more projects will be added to this repository. Planned future additions include:

- ✅ Token contracts (fungible and non-fungible)
- 🗳️ Voting systems
- 🎮 On-chain games
- 🏛️ DAO primitives
- 🔄 Cross-contract interactions

## 📚 About Clarity & Stacks

**Clarity** is a decidable smart contract language developed by Blockstack and Algorand, designed for predictability and safety. It powers smart contracts on the **Stacks blockchain**, which enables building decentralized applications secured by Bitcoin via the Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism.

Stay tuned for more updates as I expand this repository with new ideas and implementations!
